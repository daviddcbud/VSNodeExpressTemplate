# Visual Studio starter app for Node.Js Express4 Angular MongoDB (MEAN stack)



Visual Studio has a nice nodejs express template but it's based off of Express 3 (as of 4/28/14).

My goal with this project was to create a starter app that has a folder structure in place to support node.js/express on the server side
and angularjs on the client side. It also has some sample code for pulling data from mongodb.


This template also includes bower to manage client side dependencies.

My background is in ASP.NET MVC so creating this starter app is a way for me to learn some exciting new technologies.
